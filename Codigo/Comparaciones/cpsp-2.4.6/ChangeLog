version 2.4.6  Martin Mann

2012-02-29 Martin Mann
	* configure.ac : adaption to aclocal 1.11.1
	* tests/Makefile.am : adaption to automake 1.11.1
	* cpsp/gecode/GC_ThreadingSpace : adaption to gcc-4.5.3 compiler issues
	* cpsp/SideChain/chain_threading : adaption to gcc-4.5.3 compiler issues
	* bin/HPrand : adaption to gcc-4.5.3 compiler issues
	* bin/side_chain_optdeg : adaption to gcc-4.5.3 compiler issues
	+ CoreDB/1 + CoreDB/2 : missing core data was causing segfault in HPdesign
	* bin/HPdesign : minimal number of H monomers in the sequences to design is
	  now set to 2 (instead of 1, used so far). this ensures the assumed minimal
	  core size of 2 with the CPSP threading. (thanks to Premal Shah) 

version 2.4.5  Martin Mann

2011-01-19 Martin Mann
	* adaptions to BIU-2.3.5 and new gcc-4 compiler issues
	* HPrep :
	  + new functionality to construct a string representation of an equivalence
	    class for a given structure (new parameter '-abs'). the class string
	    representation is a normalized string encoding of relative distances
	    of the H-monomer (segments). thus, the representation unique for each
	    structure and insensitive to rotation or reflection. 

version 2.4.4  Martin Mann

2010-06-25 Martin Mann
	* HPconvert :
	  + p2n : direct conversion from XYZ point file to normalized abs moves

version 2.4.3  Martin Mann

2010-03-09 Martin Mann
	* HPviewSC :
	  * BUGFIX : sequence was not optional as it should have been 
	    (thanks to Cameron Smith)

version 2.4.2  Martin Mann

2009-06-09 Martin Mann
	* GC_ThreadingSpaceHcoreDist :
	  + uses now a FirstSolBranching to assign the P-variables resulting in 
	    reduced memory and runtime consumption
	* HPstruct :
	  + new distance options 'REP' for HPrep capabilites

version 2.4.1  Martin Mann

2009-06-08 Martin Mann
	* GC_ThreadingSpaceHcoreDist :

	    P monomers. This ensures the solution enumeration with distinct H-core
	    placement based on the last solution only.
	* configure.ac : automatic C*FLAGS setup via AC_PROG_C* checks disabled
	* SideChainThreading :
	  + ranked view selection : first on H side chain variables, rest afterwards

version 2.4.0  Martin Mann

2009-05-30 Martin Mann
	* BUGFIX : GC_HPThreading::countBAB : was returning 2 times the generated
	  structure number
	  --> therefore HPrep and HPstruct with distMode != NONE in count mode 
	      was returning wrong result (multiplied by 2)

2009-05-29 Martin Mann
	+ GC_ThreadingSpaceHcoreDist : space that generates only solutions that 
	  differ in at least one H-core position
	+ HPrep : new tool

	    that differ in at least one H-core position

	  the corresponding H-cores and therefore in the H-monomer distribution. The
	  number of shapes can be used as a measure for degeneracy that can
	  be faster calculated and that respects that only H-monomers contribute to

	  to all sequences that have X as an optimal structure and are below a given
	  maximal degeneracy and are direct or indirect sequence neighbors of S

2006-12-22
	* HPstruct tool : new parameter "-noRecomp" switchs of recomputation of the
	  search engine
	* DDS is started after DFS has fixed singletons- and rim-variables (before
